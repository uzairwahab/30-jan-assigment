1. Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to the following 
criteria: 
Marks                 Grade 
>90                    A 
>80 and <=90           B 
>=60 and <=80          c 
below 60               d 
ANS. marks= int(input('enter your marks'))
            if marks>90:
               print('you are in the grade A')
            elif marks>80 and marks<90:
               print('your in the  gread B')
            elif marks>=60 and marks<80:
               print('your in the  gread c')
            else:
                    print('below')
        
        


2. Write a program to accept the cost price of a bike and display the road tax to be paid according to the 
following criteria: 
Tax             Cost Price(in Rs) 
15%            >100000
10%             50000 and <= 100000 
5%             <= 50000 
ANS. cost_price = int(input('Enter your cost price'))
if cost_price>10000:
     print('tex is 15% for your cost price')
elif cost_price>5000 and cost_price<=10000:
     print('tex is 10% for your cost price')
elif cost_price<=5000:
     print('tex is 5% for your cost price')
else :
     print('you are not eligible for tex')               
             
             
3. Accept any city from the user and display monuments of that city. 
City                   Monument 
Delhi                  Red Fort 
Agra                   Taj Mahal 
Agra Jaipur            Jal Mahal 
ANS.city = input('Enter your city')
if city == 'Delhi':
    print('red fort is the best plece to visite in delhi')
elif city == 'Jaipur':
    print('Jal Mahal is the best plece to visite in delhi')
elif city == 'Agra':
    print('Taj mahal is the best plece to visite in delhi')    
else :
    print('enter velid city')



4. Check how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10. 
ANS. 
def division_count(number):
    count = 0
    while number > 10:
        number = number / 3
        count += 1
    return count

print(division_count(27)) # Output: 2




5. Why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example 

ANS. The while loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
It is useful when you want to repeat a set of statements an unknown number of times, until a certain condition is met.
    count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Output:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5


6. Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern.

ANS.
1. Right triangle pattern:

rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print("*", end="")
    print("")

# Output:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****
2. Reverse right triangle pattern:

rows = 5
for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print("*", end="")
    print("")

# Output:
# *****
# ****
# ***
# **
# *
Diamond pattern:
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows * 2):
    for j in range(1, (rows * 2) - i):
        print(end=" ")
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print("")

for i in range(rows * 2, 0, -1):
    for j in range(1, (rows * 2)
   print(end=" ")
    for j in range(1, i):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print("")

# Output:
#     *
#    * *
#   * * *
#  * * * *
# * * * * *
#  * * * *
#   * * *
#    * *
#     *



7. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.
ans.count =  10
while  count>=1:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
10

2
1



8. Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1 
ANS.count =  10
